== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What can I use this plugin for? =

Good question! This plugin was designed to fit a very specific usecase, namely to hide a website and make parts visible
depending on how many new benefactors sign up. To accomplish this, the settings would be changed manually.

You can use this plugin in the same way, or make changes to automate this process.

= Does this plugin affect the performance of my website in any way? =

Freedom Blackout should not affect the performance in a significant way. The plugin loads no javascript files or stylesheets.
The overlay is added by printing a div tag with some inline styles to the Wordpress page.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is the settings menu. Here you can change how much of the website is hidden and edit the message that is displayed.
2. This is how the homepage looks with the plugin activated and the percentage set to 42%.
